Acme/Handwave version 0.01
==========================

Ah well, it's time I contributed to the Acme namespace. The rest of
london.pm seems to have.

Acme::Handwave is for those annoying occasions when you know your
input data, and you know what you want out of it, but you don't know
how to get there programatically. Now, you can just handwave, and the
data will magically be what you want it to be.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

It's an Acme:: module. Don't be ridiculous.
